        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Our mission is to assist buyers to get properties in a way they believe is helpful. 
    To do that, we show you personalized content and ads we think you’ll be interested in based on 
    information we collect from you and third parties. We only use that information where we have a
     proper legal basis for doing so.
</p>
<p>We wrote this policy to help you understand what information we collect, 
    how we use it and what choices

<p>you have about it. We’ve tried our best to explain things in a simple and
     clear way. We welcome your questions and comments on this policy.</p>
<h2>We collect information in different ways</h2>
<h3>1. When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it</h3>
<p>When you sign up for or use Cuboid you voluntarily share certain information including your name, email address, phone number, National identity cards, comments, and any other information you give us. You can also choose to share your precise location using your device settings or through photos. We will still use your IP address, which is used to approximate your location, even if you don't choose to share your precise location. You will also have the option to share other information about yourself such as your gender.</p>
<p>If you connect your <b>Facebook,</b><b>Google</b> (opens in a new window) or other third-party accounts to Cuboid, we use information from those accounts  to improve your Cuboid experience. This is dependent on the privacy policies or settings for those accounts.
</p>
<h2>2. We also get technical information when you use Cuboid</h2>
<p>When you use a website, mobile application or other internet service, certain internet and electronic network activity information gets created and logged automatically. This is also true when you use Cuboid. Here are some of the types of information we collect:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Log data:</b> When you use Cuboid, our servers record information (“log data”), including information that your browser automatically sends whenever you visit a website, or that your mobile app automatically sends when you’re using it. This log data includes your Internet Protocol address (which we use to infer your approximate location), the address of and activity on websites you visit that incorporate Cuboid features (like the “Save” button—more details below), searches, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, how you used Cuboid, cookie data and device data. 
</li>
    <li>Cookie data. We also use “cookies” (small text files sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Cuboid account or your browser) or similar technologies to get log data. When we use cookies or other similar technologies, we use session cookies (that last until you close your browser) or persistent cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we use cookies to store your language preferences or other settings so you don‘t have to set them up every time you visit Cuboid. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your Cuboid account (including information about you, such as the email address you gave us) and other cookies are not. 
  </li>
    <li><b>Device information:</b> In addition to log data, we collect information about the device you’re using Cuboid on, including the type of device, operating system, settings, unique device identifiers and crash data that helps us understand when something breaks.
</li>
    <li><b>Clickstream data and inferences:</b> When you’re on Cuboid, we use your activity—such as when you click on, flip books you create, and any text that you add in a comment or description—along with information you provided when you first signed up and information from our partners and advertisers to make inferences about you and your preferences. 
</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Our partners and advertisers share information with us</h2>
<p>We also get information about you and your activity outside Cuboid from our affiliates, advertisers, partners and other third parties we work with. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Some websites or apps use Cuboid features such as our “Save” button, or you may install our “Save” button for your browser. If so, we collect log data from those sites or apps. 
</li>
<li>Online advertisers or third parties share information with us to measure, report on or improve the performance of ads on Cuboid, or to figure out what kinds of ads to show you on or off of Cuboid. This includes information about your visits to an advertiser's site or purchases you made from them, or information about your interests from a third-party service, which we might use to help show you ads. 
</li>

</ul>
<h2>What we do with the info we collect</h2>
<p>We’re committed to showing you content that’s relevant to you. To do that, we use your information to provide and improve your experience, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Identify you when you use Cuboid.
</li>
<li>Recommend categories you might like based on your activity on Cuboid. For example, if we see you’re interested with high end properties we may show you those type of properties or related ads.
</li>
<li>Respond to your questions or comments.
</li>
</ul>
<p>We have a legitimate interest for using your information in these ways. It's fundamental to what we do at Cuboid and necessary in order to make Cuboid and its features relevant and personalized to you.
</p>
<p>We also have a legitimate interest in making Cuboid safe and improving our product features so you keep finding what you want. We all benefit when we use your information to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Work with law enforcement and keep Cuboid safe. We may get requests for account information from law enforcement authorities like the police or courts. 
</li>
<li>Review your messages on Cuboid to detect activity that poses a risk to the safety of you, our community and/or members of the public.
</li>
<li>Conduct analytics and research on who is using Cuboid and what they are doing. For example, by logging how often people use two different versions of a feature on Cuboid, we can understand which version is better.
</li>
<li>Improve Cuboid and offer new features.
</li>
<li>Advertise Cuboid products and services to you on other sites. </li>
<li>Send you updates (such as when certain activity, like new properties get listed on Cuboid) and updates by email or push notification, depending on your settings. For example, we send weekly updates that include properties you may like. You can decide to stop getting these notifications by updating your settings.
</li>
</ul>
<p>We have a legitimate interest in delivering ads that are relevant, to you. To further these interests we use the information we collect to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Decide which ads to show you. For example, if you show an interest in camping tents on Cuboid, we may show you ads for other outdoor products. We customize the ad content we show you by identifying your interests based on your onsite and offsite activities, as well as by using information we receive from ad partners or other third parties. Where we use cookies to identify your offsite interests, we’ll get your consent where we need to. Where ad partners or other third parties share information with us about you, we rely on the consent they already obtained.
</li>
<li>Tell our ad partners how their Cuboid ads are doing, and how to make them better. Some of this information is aggregated.
</li>
<li>We have a legitimate interest in using information we collect to customize your Cuboid experience based on your offsite behavior. When we identify your interests based on your offsite behavior with cookies, we will obtain any consent that we may need. 
</li>
<li>In addition to the specific circumstances above, we’ll only use your information with your consent in order to:
</li>
<li>Send you marketing materials by email, text, push notification or phone call depending on your account or operating system settings. Each time we send you marketing materials, we give you the option to unsubscribe.
</li>
<li>Identify your precise location and customize the content we show you. For example, if we know that you’re near a certain property we may show you that locations properties that may be of interest to you. You can opt in to this in your device operating system settings.
</li>
<li>Tell our ad partners how their ads are doing using the Cuboid Tag. The Cuboid Tag (a piece of code an advertiser puts on their site) delivers insights to us and our ad partners about actions that a person takes on their website after viewing an ad on Cuboid. 
</li>
<li>We’ll also rely on your consent where we use cookies to:
</li>
<li>Identify you across different browser sessions. This means if you log into Cuboid from your phone (or any device), we'll remember that you're you and then you won't need to enter your login details each time you visit Cuboid.
</li>
<li>Show you ads you might be interested in. We use cookies to identify your interests based on your offsite activity. We do this for people currently using Cuboid and for new folks, and it helps us customize how you get started on Cuboid.
</li>

</ul>

</p>
<h2>How and when we share information</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Third-party companies, service providers or individuals that we employ to process information on our behalf based on our instructions and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we share data with security consultants to help us get better at identifying spam. Some information we acquire may be collected by third-party providers on our behalf.
</li>
<li>Law enforcement agencies or government agencies. We only share information if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or Cuboid; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
</li>
<li>Our wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliates. If we were to engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy, we would share your information with a party involved in such a process (for example, a potential purchaser).
</li>
</ul>
<h2>How information is stored and protected</h2>
<p>We follow the industry's standards on information security management to protect sensitive user information.</p>
<p>We take steps to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage.
</p>
<p>Where you have chosen a password which allows you to access certain parts of the Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We advise you not to share your password with anyone.
</p>
<p>We cannot guarantee the absolute security of their users' personal information since no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.
</p>
<h2>How long we keep your information</h2>
<p>We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide services to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.
</p>
